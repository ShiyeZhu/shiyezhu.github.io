My research experience spans a range of areas, including the biodegradation of organic pollutants, the interaction between environmental microorganisms and substrates, the preparation of nanomaterials, transcriptome analysis, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT), and the characterization of nanomaterial microstructures. I have contributed to 15 related scientific papers, with 6 of them as the first author, inculding <strong><em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em>, <strong><em>Colloids and Surfaces A-Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects</em>, and so on.
