My research experience spans a range of areas, including the biodegradation of organic pollutants, the interaction between environmental microorganisms and substrates, the preparation of nanomaterials, transcriptome analysis, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT), and the characterization of nanomaterial microstructures. I have contributed to 17 related scientific papers, with 7 of them as the first author, inculding <em>Journal of Hazardous Materials</em>, <em>Chemical Engineering Journal</em>, <em>Colloids and Surfaces A-Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects</em>, and so on.

My long-term research goal is to understand the connection between the enviernmental microbiology and human healthy. My primary research aim to address critical global challenges, including elemental geochemical cycles, cell stress adaptations, contaminant attenuation, and public health concerns.
