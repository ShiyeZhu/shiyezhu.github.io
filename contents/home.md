My research is primarily focused on the mechanisms of interaction between environmental microorganisms and organic pollutants. I have published my findings in esteemed journals such as the Chemical Engineering Journal (SCI 2024 IF=13.3), Colloids and Surfaces A: Physicochemical and Engineering Aspects (SCI 2024 IF=4.9), and Journal of Food Science (SCI 2024 IF=3.2), as well as in China Oil (CSCD). I have contributed to 15 scientific papers, with 6 of them as the first author.

I have also been proactive in innovation, filing 5 national patents as the first student inventor, with 3 of them granted, including one invention patent. I have led a key provincial graduate research and innovation project and successfully concluded 2 provincial and institutional research projects. My leadership in the 4th Hunan Province "Internet+" competition resulted in a silver award for the project I led.

I have participated in over 10 academic conferences both domestically and internationally, securing 4 provincial academic innovation awards. In November 2019, I was honored with an invitation to present a keynote speech at the 4th International Symposium on Lipid Science and Health in the youth forum of the conference.

My research experience spans a range of areas, including the biodegradation of organic pollutants, the interaction between environmental microorganisms and substrates, the preparation of nanomaterials, transcriptome analysis, computational simulations such as molecular dynamics (MD) and density functional theory (DFT), and the characterization of nanomaterial microstructures.
